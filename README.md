Linux Git Client
=============

CGuit it's a linux graphical client for git.

Updates
-------
There's not will be any update or description until version 0.1 goes out. when this happens, I'll update all the necesary info here and wiki.

Install requirements
--------------------
* libgtk-3-dev
* libgee-dev
* libssl-dev ( Required by libgit )

now I'm using my own [libgit2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2) (installed it here), so if you want to test it you need to run `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/go/to/the/program/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before start the application.

Licence
-------
Check the file COPYING for more details. (it's not here yet)
